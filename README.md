# sig-design
Special Interest Group for Design (User Research, Interface, and Experience)


The Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) Design SIG missionette is to

1. Demand healthcare infrastructure design be open source.

The algorithms that drive our care are governed by black boxes. The Design of those services, from modeling to user interface and experience are often plagued by crooked biases. We aim to democratize healthcare technology for all participants through open source design.


2. Infect LF Public Health projects with Open Design.

Many LF projects already have interface design, but they may not have Design. The Design process needs to be transparent and open to all…
to grow community buy-in,
to receive and respond to design feedback, and
to democratize design knowledge management.

We will work with, guide the community about, and ship good design.


3. Make user experience guidance and best practices for open source healthcare services.

Co-create guidelines for user interface, user experience, and product strategy that anyone can use to increase the human happiness quotient when using LF health services. These best practice examples will
... improve readability and understandability of a person’s or populous’ health status,
... vaccinate LFPH efforts with good design research process
... establish measurable metrics that show design success (with the people that use the service and within community development)

All work will be open source, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license (https://github.com/lfph/sig-ui-ux/blob/master/LICENSE), and produced, discussed, and critiqued in the open, from day 1.


We are looking for fellow designers, engineers, and public health apostles to establish a Design force within the LFPH. Please email (juhan@mit.edu) and/or join the Slack channel (lfpublichealth.slack.com) for community jamming.
